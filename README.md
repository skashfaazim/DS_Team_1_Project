Business case
The team has selected the Bike Sharing dataset by UC Irvine. Our analysis will look at weather factors and time of year to see how these variables affect the types of riders, registered vs. casual. 
1. How do the percentages of casual vs registered depending on the day of week, i.e. workweek vs weekend?
2. do holidays, low windspeed, high temperature increase casual ridership?
3. Given a certain type of weather, how does time of the year or season affect ridership levels? 
4. Does the rate of weather change affect ridership? 
5. What time of the day on weekends vs weekdays, do we see the greatest increase in casual vs. registered ridership?
6. Is there a variance in ridership levels that is caused by outliers? (Are there any errors in data collection from the machine that is tracking the data?) Checking any high spikes, and seeing what possible causes there could be for that spike. 
7. What time of the day on weekends vs weekdays, do we see the greatest increase in casual vs. registered ridership?
